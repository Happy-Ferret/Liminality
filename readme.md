# Liminality

__Liminality__ is a Linux MDM login manager theme that features for the first time of Human history (for MDM themes), a video as a moving background.
How did I manage that ? As you might know, the embedded version of *webkit* used in MDM does know allow us to use `<video>` tags, so I fragmented my video into numerous `png` chunks and looped them to produce this result.

## Installation

Tarball this repo,  run `mdmsetup`, and load it through the gui client.
